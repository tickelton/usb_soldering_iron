Inspired by [ole00's](https://github.com/ole00) [zd-20u](https://github.com/ole00/zd-20u) the goal of this project is to modify a cheap USB soldering iron bought on eBay to enable advanced functionality.

Features:

* Multiple temperature levels.
* USB TTY interface.
* Microchip ATTiny85 microcontroller.
* [Micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) bootloader for easy firmware updates.
